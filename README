README        The file you're now reading.

bigbang.rb    A program that populates the "database" with a set of
              random tasks.

clocktime.rb  A class (mostly experimental) for storing time without
              a date.

storage.rb    A primitive storage mechanism using YAML files.

timecop.rb    The main file with all important definitions.

test.rb       Test code to exercise parts of the API (very immature!
              doesn't even use Test::Unit or report results).

dview.rb      A primitive "daily view" program -- give it a date on the
              command line and it responds with a list of all the tasks
              in the database that match that day.


Notes, Issues, Problems
-----------------------

1. When I first started to write this 3 years ago, I used an elaborate
   inheritance model. Now I'm not using that. I'm not sure which is 
   right. It seems simpler in some ways not to use inheritance here -- 
   but the downside is that some objects will have attributes that are 
   meaningless.

2. Right now there is no importance, urgency, nag, warn, duration, or
   any of that stuff.

3. I *do* handle non-repeating tasks and four kinds of repeating tasks.

4. I use some terminology that I borrowed from elsewhere. We can keep it
   or toss it.
     - a "task" is any item at all, with or without a date/time
     - an "appointment" by nature must have a date (defaulting to "today")
     - a "todo" item by nature cannot have a specific date
